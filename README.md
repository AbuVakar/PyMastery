## Overview

PyMastery's main USP is its unified learning workflow. Instead of acting like a static course website, it combines:

- structured course-based learning
- hands-on coding practice
- AI-assisted guidance
- user authentication and protected progress flows
- responsive dashboard-driven learning experience

## Current Status

The repository is in a strong demo and portfolio state.

- Core web flows such as signup, login, logout, protected routes, dashboard, courses, enrollment, and contact are working.
- AI works with live Gemini when provider quota and configuration are available, and otherwise falls back to an explicitly labeled `Demo Mode AI`.
- Code execution works only when a Judge0 service is available. If Judge0 is not reachable, the UI keeps execution clearly disabled instead of pretending it works.
- The repo also contains some legacy and preview-only pages that are not the primary production surface.

## Core Features

- User authentication with JWT-based sessions
- Protected dashboard and profile flows
- Course listing and enrollment
- Coding problem browsing and solve flow
- AI assistant for learning support
- Contact and support flow
- Responsive React frontend for desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- Database: MongoDB
- Auth: JWT access and refresh tokens
- Testing: Vitest, Playwright, Pytest
- Optional integrations: Google OAuth, Gemini, Judge0, SMTP

## Local Setup

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`, then start the API:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env` from `frontend/.env.example`, then start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open The App

- Frontend: [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173)
- Backend docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Health check: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health)

## Required Environment Variables

### Backend

- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- `MONGODB_URL`
- `DATABASE_NAME`

### Recommended Backend Variables

- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- `EMAIL_FROM`
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL`

### Optional Integrations

- Google OAuth: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`
- Gemini: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`
- Judge0: `JUDGE0_API_URL`, `JUDGE0_API_KEY`, `JUDGE0_HOST`
- Email/SMTP: `SMTP_HOST` or `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME` or `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`

## Testing

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test
npm run test:ui-smoke
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pytest -q
```

## Notes

- Do not commit `.env` files or secret keys.
- If Gemini is unavailable, the app will show `Demo Mode AI`.
- If Judge0 is unavailable, code execution stays disabled with a clear user-facing message.
- If email or OAuth are not configured, the app degrades gracefully and reports that status honestly.
